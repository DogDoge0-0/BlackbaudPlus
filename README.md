# Blackbaud-Plus
An extension to improve the way Blackbaud functions. Very customizable.

## Features

### Current Features
- Dark mode/Spooky mode
- Grade percent converter

### Under Development/Planned Updates
- A major fix to how dark mode changes color, so that it will intelligently decide wether or not to change the elements color nased off of its normal display colors. The current system just changes everything, with no resolve for what it once looked like, this will add some color back into blackbaud, while keeping its dark mode framework.
- A update to the Grade Percent Converter that adds a third option to view grades as only a percent, the current system only shows grades on hover of the element. (Priority)
